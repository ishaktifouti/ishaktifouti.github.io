<p>
My research focuses on the development, analysis, and implementation of nonlinear adaptive model order reduction methods for parameterized partial differential equations, with applications to compressible flows and harmonic wave inversion. My background is in partial differential equations and numerical analysis, with training in the development of numerical methods.

<h2>Projection-based nonlinear model reduction</h2>
<p>
I develop projection-based reduced-order models for nonlinear parameterized PDEs. In particular, I worked on integrating registration techniques within model reduction and mesh adaptation frameworks in order to handle advection-dominated regimes and moving features. The objective is to construct reduced models that remain accurate and efficient when dealing with transport-dominated flows.

I also investigated local reduced-order modeling strategies based on clustering techniques, where the parameter domain is partitioned into subsets and dedicated reduced spaces are constructed for each cluster. This approach improves robustness in the presence of strong parametric variability.</p>

<h2>Mesh adaptation based on error estimates</h2>
<p>
I develop metric-based mesh adaptation strategies driven by error models. In practice, I construct error indicators (feature-based, residual-based, or goal-oriented) that define Riemannian metric fields used to guide anisotropic or isotropic refinement and coarsening under a fixed complexity budget. This approach allows control of the discretization error while concentrating degrees of freedom only where required.</p>

<h2>Error estimation and adjoint-based methods</h2>
<p>
I work on error estimation methods, with an emphasis on adjoint-based and goal-oriented techniques. These goal-oriented error models are used to drive adaptivity both in the physical space and in the parameter space, guiding reduced-order modeling and mesh adaptation strategies.</p>

<h2>Reduced modeling for harmonic wave inversion</h2>
<p>
My current research investigates reduced-order modeling for inverse problems in the frequency domain, in particular harmonic full-wave inversion. The goal is to accelerate repeated forward and adjoint solves required by optimization-based inversion, while maintaining accuracy through efficient reduced models and adaptive strategies.
</p>

<h2>System identification and non-intrusive methods</h2>
<p>
During my master’s thesis, I worked on non-intrusive nonlinear model reduction for unsteady coupled PDEs arising in fluid–structure interaction. This work focused on data-driven dynamical modeling and system identification methods that reconstruct evolution operators from observable outputs.
