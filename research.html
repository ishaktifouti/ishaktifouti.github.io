My research focuses on the development, analysis, and implementation of nonlinear adaptive model order reduction techniques for parameterized partial differential equations.
</p>

<h2>Projection-based nonlinear model reduction</h2>
<p>
I develop intrusive projection-based reduced-order models for nonlinear parameterized PDEs. 
My work includes registration-based approaches that introduce spatio-parameter adaptivity in order to capture localized structures and transport-dominated phenomena. 
These methods are designed for problems where classical linear reduction techniques fail due to strong nonlinearities and moving features.
</p>

<h2>Mesh adaptation based on error estimates</h2>
<p>
I develop metric-based mesh adaptation strategies driven by error models. 
In particular, I construct anisotropic error indicators and use them to define mesh metrics that guide local refinement and coarsening. 
The objective is to control the discretization error efficiently in advection-dominated and hyperbolic regimes, while coupling mesh adaptation with reduced-order modeling techniques.
</p>

<h2>Error estimation and adjoint-based methods</h2>
<p>
I work on goal-oriented error estimation using adjoint-based techniques. 
This includes the derivation and implementation of dual-weighted residual methods and the construction of reliable output error indicators. 
These tools are used both to assess the accuracy of reduced models and to drive adaptive strategies in space and parameter.
</p>

<h2>Inverse problems and harmonic full-wave inversion</h2>
<p>
I investigate the use of reduced-order models for inverse problems, in particular harmonic full-wave inversion in wave propagation settings. 
In this context, reduced modeling is used to accelerate repeated forward and adjoint simulations required by optimization-based inversion procedures.
</p>

<h2>System identification and non-intrusive methods</h2>
<p>
During my master's thesis at Sorbonne Université, I developed non-intrusive nonlinear model reduction techniques for unsteady coupled fluid–structure interaction problems. 
This work focused on data-driven approaches and system identification strategies for complex multiphysics systems.
